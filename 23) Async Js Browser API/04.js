Callbacks and Promises are both mechanisms used for managing asynchronous code in JavaScript. However, Promises offer several advantages over traditional callback-based approaches:

1.Readability and Maintainability: Promises provide a more structured and readable way to handle asynchronous operations compared to nested callbacks. Promises allow chaining of asynchronous operations using methods like `then()`, `catch()`, and `finally()`, leading to code that is easier to understand and maintain.

2.Error Handling: With Promises, error handling is centralized and cleaner compared to callbacks, where error handling often leads to callback hell (nested callbacks). Promises allow you to chain `.catch()` handlers to handle errors at any point in the chain, making it easier to manage errors.

3.Avoiding Callback Hell: Promises help prevent the problem of callback hell, which occurs when multiple asynchronous operations are nested inside each other, leading to deeply nested and hard-to-read code. Promises allow you to flatten the asynchronous code structure by chaining `.then()` calls, making the code more manageable.

4.Composition: Promises support composition, which means you can combine multiple asynchronous operations together using methods like `Promise.all()` and `Promise.race()`. This allows you to execute multiple asynchronous operations concurrently or in sequence and handle the result collectively.

5.Error Propagation: Promises automatically propagate errors through the chain until they are handled by a `.catch()` handler. This ensures that errors are not silently ignored and makes it easier to track and debug issues in asynchronous code.

6.Support for Synchronous Code: Promises provide a consistent interface for both synchronous and asynchronous operations. You can wrap synchronous code in a Promise using `Promise.resolve()` or `Promise.reject()`, making it easier to integrate with asynchronous code.

Overall, Promises offer a cleaner, more expressive, and more maintainable way to manage asynchronous code compared to callbacks.
